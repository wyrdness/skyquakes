      "full": "Skyquakes are unexplained loud booming sounds that seem to come from the sky or horizon, reported throughout human history and across all inhabited continents. These mysterious acoustic phenomena, also known as \\\"mistpouffers,\\\" \\\"Barisal guns,\\\" \\\"uminari\\\" (sea roar), or \\\"lake guns,\\\" manifest as powerful, cannon-like explosions, rumbling thunder, or sonic boom-like sounds occurring during clear weather conditions when no obvious source is present. Unlike conventional thunder, earthquakes, or military exercises, skyquakes often occur without any corresponding seismic activity, weather disturbances, or known human activity. The phenomenon has been documented for centuries, with reports from coastal areas, near large bodies of water, and in mountainous regions worldwide. While various scientific explanations have been proposed—ranging from atmospheric phenomena to geological activity—many skyquake events remain unexplained, continuing to puzzle scientists, seismologists, and acoustic researchers. The sounds can vary from single sharp reports to sustained rolling booms, sometimes accompanied by ground vibrations, building rattles, or pressure waves felt by witnesses."
